        <h2>Technical Interview</h2>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">1.</span>How method overloading is different from method overriding?</div>
            <div class="answer">
               <ul>
                <li><strong>Method overloading </strong>means methods are having the same name, but they differ either in the number of arguments or in the type of arguments. It is done during compile time, so it is known as compile-time polymorphism.</li>.
                <li><strong>Method overriding</strong>means the ability to define subclass and super-class methods with the same name as well as the same method signatures, here the subclass method will override the super-class method. It is performed during run time, so it is known as run-time polymorphism.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">2.</span> What is a foreign key?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A foreign key is a field in one table that references the primary key in another table. The table containing the foreign key is referred to as the child table, whereas the table containing the main key is referred to as the referenced or parent table.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span>  What are DDL and DML commands in SQL?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                    <li>DDL refers to Data Definition Language. DDL commands are used to define database schema i.e., to create and modify the database object structure in the database. Examples are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc.</li>
                    <li>DML refers to Data Manipulation Language. DML commands are used to manipulate the data within the database. Examples are: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span>   Why indexing in SQL is useful ?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A SQL index is a quick lookup table that helps to find records that are frequently searched by a user. An index is fast, small, and optimized for quick look-ups. It is useful for establishing a connection between the relational tables, searching large tables, and fast retrieval of data from a database.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span> Write a program to print ASCII code for a character using JAVA.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <code>
                    import java.util.Scanner;<br>
                    class Main
                    {<br>
                        public static void main(String[] args)
                        {<br>
                            char c='A';	<br>
                            int i = c;<br>
                            System.out.println("ASCII value of "+c+" is "+i);<br>
                            
                        }<br>
                    }<br>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">5.</span>What is meant by a null pointer?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The pointer that does not point to any memory location is called the null pointer. It implies the pointer is empty and it is not pointing to anywhere within the memory.
                Example: int *pointer=NULL;<br>
                Null pointers can be used for initializing the memory location address with the pointer of the same data type.
                Example: int *pointer= (int*)NULL;

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">6.</span> What is the order of B+ tree?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A B+ tree of order m is a search tree with up to m children for each non-leaf node. The actual components of the collection are stored in the tree’s leaves, whereas the non-leaf nodes hold just keys.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">7.</span>  What are BLOCK statements in SQL?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A block is the smallest significant collection of code in SQL, as it is in most other procedural languages. A block is a unit of code that supports variable declaration and exception handling with execution and scoping boundaries.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">8.</span> What is SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p> SDLC is an end-to-end process that defines the software development flow starting from the requirements stage to the maintenance and support stage. The SDLC stages are requirements analysis, planning, definition, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and support.</p>

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">9.</span>What is polymorphism?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                It is absolutely remarkable in its ability to construct many diverse shapes with only one use of a function. The term merely implies this because poly means many or several times and morphism denotes shapes. As a result, its primary function in the Java programming language is to process many sorts of classes and objects via a single piece of an interface, which distinguishes it.

            <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>EXE</strong> file extension is used for executable files, it recognizes the file as a program. It runs independently. An EXE creates separate memory and process space for it.</li>
                    <li><strong>DLL</strong> stands for a dynamic link library that has functions and procedures used by other applications. This DLL can be reused by multiple applications. It will share the same memory and process space of the calling application.</li>
