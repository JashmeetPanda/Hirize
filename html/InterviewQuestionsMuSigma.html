            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">1.</span> What is procedural programming?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Procedural Programming may be the first programming paradigm learned by a new developer. The procedural code, in its simplest form, is the code that tells a device how to do a task in a logical sequence. Data and methods are seen as two distinct entities in this paradigm, which follows a linear top-down approach.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">2.</span> What do you mean by Run Time Error?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A runtime error arises when a program is syntactically correct but contains an issue that is only discovered during program execution. The Java compiler cannot detect these problems at compile time, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) detects them only when the application is running.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span>  What is Control System?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                When the output and inputs of a system are interconnected in such a way that the output quantity or variable is controlled by the input quantity, the system is referred to as a control system. The controlled variable or response is the output quantity, while the command signal or excitation is the input quantity.

            <div class="answer">
                UNIX is an entire operating system package designed primarily for servers, workstations, and mainframes. It is a trademarked name. It can only be used by the copyright holders. It features an entirely distinct coding devised by AT&T labs, is highly secure, and has listed approximately 85-120 viruses to date.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">9.</span>What is polymorphism?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                It is absolutely remarkable in its ability to construct many diverse shapes with only one use of a function. The term merely implies this because poly means many or several times and morphism denotes shapes. As a result, its primary function in the Java programming language is to process many sorts of classes and objects via a single piece of an interface, which distinguishes it.

                    <li><strong>EXE</strong> file extension is used for executable files, it recognizes the file as a program. It runs independently. An EXE creates separate memory and process space for it.</li>
                    <li><strong>DLL</strong> stands for a dynamic link library that has functions and procedures used by other applications. This DLL can be reused by multiple applications. It will share the same memory and process space of the calling application.</li>

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">1.</span>Tell me something not mentioned in your resume.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                One aspect not mentioned in my resume is my involvement in volunteer work at a local non-profit organization focused on teaching coding skills to underprivileged youth. This experience has been incredibly rewarding as it allowed me to share my passion for technology while making a positive impact in my community. It also helped me develop strong communication skills as I learned how to explain complex concepts in an accessible way. Through this work, I’ve realized the importance of giving back and keeping interest in technology among younger generations.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span>Are you comfortable working night shifts?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes, I am comfortable working night shifts if required by the role. I understand that certain projects may necessitate flexible hours due to client needs or collaboration across different time zones. My priority is contributing effectively to my team and ensuring project success, so I am willing to adapt my schedule as needed. Additionally, I believe that flexibility can lead to unique opportunities for collaboration with global teams, enhancing both personal growth and project outcomes.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span> How do you lead people?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                As a team leader, I’ve always believed that we shouldn’t ask a team member to perform anything that we can do better ourselves. And I follow this guideline. My co-workers are aware that I will never ask them to do anything that I won’t do myself. This builds team trust and promotes productivity at work.

                Yes, thank you for asking. I’m curious about the opportunities for professional development within MuSigma, specifically how the company supports employees who wish to pursue further education or certifications. Additionally, could you share more about the team within the department I’ll potentially be joining? Understanding these aspects will help me understand how well I can align with the company’s goals while also pursuing my career aspirations effectively.
