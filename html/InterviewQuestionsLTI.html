                RDBMSs are database management programs that keep track of the records and indexes of data in tables. Relationships may be established and maintained between the data and tables as well as between them. Tables in a relational database are used to represent the relationships between data elements. Instead of using pointers, these tables’ interdependencies are expressed by data values.

            <div class="answer">
                Good Morning Sir/Madam.
                Thank you for providing me this chance to introduce myself, first of all. My name is Jagriti. I’m from Vizag. I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from ABC College, which is a part of XYZ University. My strengths are I am self-motivated and an optimistic thinker. My short-term objective is to land a decent job at a reputable firm, and my long-term objective is to land a solid position where I can further my career and benefit the business. My work ethic dictates that I never pass up a chance to develop myself.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span> How is confidence different from overconfidence?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                There’s a thin line between being confident and being overconfident. Whether you believe you have the ability to complete the task is determined by your trust. And you’re overconfident if you believe you’re the only one who can comfortably complete the mission and that no one else can do it as well as you. As a result, trust is beneficial, while overconfidence is harmful. Your overconfidence has resulted in the loss of your employment.

I would really want to devote my time over the coming years to improve myself in order to meet the needs of the organization and contribute to its expansion. Additionally, I want to assist individuals in any way I can.
