            <div class="answer">

            <div class="answer">
                It is absolutely remarkable in its ability to construct many diverse shapes with only one use of a function. The term merely implies this because poly means many or several times and morphism denotes shapes. As a result, its primary function in the Java programming language is to process many sorts of classes and objects via a single piece of an interface, which distinguishes it.

        <h2>HR Interview</h2>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">1.</span>  Tell me something not mentioned in your resume.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                One aspect not mentioned in my resume is my involvement in volunteer work at a local non-profit organization focused on teaching coding skills to underprivileged youth. This experience has been incredibly rewarding as it allowed me to share my passion for technology while making a positive impact in my community. It also helped me develop strong communication skills as I learned how to explain complex concepts in an accessible way. Through this work, I’ve realized the importance of giving back and keeping interest in technology among younger generations.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">2.</span>  What software are you familiar with?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                I’m proficient with programs like PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel. I’m now taking a course in Power BI and Azure, and soon I’ll be an expert.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span> What is the most difficult situation that you have ever faced in life?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The most difficult task in my job experience was being expected to manage a new technological domain as part of my project. Despite my training in technology, it was difficult to understand the needs and validate the work required. My manager, on the other hand, was a lovely person who stayed by me in the early days and gave me extra days to work things out. After a few jobs, I was on my way to being an expert and was able to assist many of the others who joined me.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span>How do you handle conflicts in a team?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                I address conflicts directly and constructively. First, I listen to all parties to understand their perspectives. This helps me see the situation from different angles. Then, I facilitate an open discussion where everyone can express their concerns. I encourage team members to share their thoughts honestly. This approach helps us find common ground and work towards a solution. For example, in my last project, two team members disagreed on the approach to a task. I organized a meeting to discuss our viewpoints, and we reached a compromise that satisfied everyone.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">5.</span>Do you have any questions for us?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes, thank you for asking. I’m curious about the opportunities for professional development within HCL, specifically how the company supports employees who wish to pursue further education or certifications. Additionally, could you share more about the team within the department I’ll potentially be joining? Understanding these aspects will help me understand how well I can align with the company’s goals while also pursuing my career aspirations effectively.
