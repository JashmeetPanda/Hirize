            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">1.</span>What is call by value and call by reference in C Programming language?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Call by value:</strong>
                The function receives a copy of the value, so the original value is not altered during the call by value.
                <br>
                <strong>Call by reference:</strong>
                The function is given a value address, so the original value is changed in the call by reference.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">2.</span> What are method overloading and method overriding?</div>
            <div class="answer">
               <strong>Method overloading:</strong>  Method overloading occurs when two methods in the same class have the same method name but different arguments. 
                <br>
                <strong>Method overriding:</strong> Method overriding occurs when two methods in the same class have the same method name and arguments.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span> List the Coffman's conditions that result in a deadlock.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Mutual Exclusion:</strong>A critical resource can only be used by one process at a time. </li>
                <li><strong>Hold & Wait: </strong>Some resources may be assigned to a process while others are awaiting allocation. </li>
                <li><strong>No Pre-emption:</strong> No resource can be forcibly removed from a process that is holding it.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Circular Wait: </strong> A closed chain of processes exists when each process has at least one resource that another process in the chain requires.</li>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span>  What is the significance of the AVL tree?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) in which the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees cannot be greater than one for any node. The above tree is AVL because the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees for each node is less than or equal to one.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span>  Why there are no global variables in Java?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Global variables can be accessed from anywhere on the globe. Java does not support globally accessible variables for the following reasons:
                 <ul><li>The global variables compromise referential transparency.</li>
                    <li>In namespace, global variables cause collisions.</li></ul>

            <div class="answer">
                The List interface is a Java Collection Framework interface. The List interface adds to the Collection interface’s functionality.
                <ul><li>It is a well-organized collection of objects.</li>

            <div class="answer">
                When multiple threads are active, a deadlock condition occurs. When one thread is waiting for an object lock that has already been acquired by another thread and the second thread is waiting for a lock object that has already been taken by the first thread, this is referred to as a deadlock condition in Java.

            <div class="answer">
                Good day, everyone. I’m ABC, and I’m from Karnataka. I recently graduated from XYZ Institution with a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. I’ve created projects that you can find on my Github page, and I’m constantly learning new skills. I recently finished my final year project on AI, which was recently published, and I was given the opportunity to present my project at various college levels. Maybe my greatest strength is that I never back down from a challenge and always face a problem square in the face. If you give me the chance. I would be a valuable asset to your company.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">2.</span>  What are your hobbies and interests?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Painting and creating new things are two of my favorite things to do. I always set aside at least 2 hours after college to paint, which helps me relax and improves my visualization skills while also improving my memory.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">3.</span> How is confidence different from overconfidence?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                There’s a thin line between being confident and being overconfident. Whether you believe you have the ability to complete the task is determined by your trust. And you’re overconfident if you believe you’re the only one who can comfortably complete the mission and that no one else can do it as well as you. As a result, trust is beneficial, while overconfidence is harmful. Your overconfidence has resulted in the loss of your employment.

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span>What are the most important things for you in a job?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The ability to deliver high-quality outcomes on schedule is the most critical component of my profession. This was very important for me during my latest internship, as I completed both my core project and a secondary optional project. The following are the specifics of such initiatives.

            <div class="answer">
                I’m an excellent fit for this position. Because of my technical skills and, in particular, my ability to manage and improve websites. 

In my most recent position, I was responsible for updating our department’s website. This necessitated the updating of student and teacher accounts, as well as the public announcement of forthcoming activities. In my spare time, I taught myself JavaScript and Swift. Our department head and Dean of Students congratulated me for taking the initiative and using my coding talents to rebuild our website.
