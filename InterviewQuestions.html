        <h2>HR Interview</h2>

            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">1.</span> Tell me about yourself.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                I stumbled upon your job description as a college grad. As per my understanding, the role requires a calm, self-assured person who is eager to take on new challenges. I am positive that I am the best candidate for this job. I studied programming on my own as a student of Mechanical Engineering. I’ve created projects that you can find on my Github, and I’m constantly learning new skills. I was an active part of the student body in my engineering class and served as a liaison between students and instructors. Perhaps my greatest strength is that I never back down from a challenge and always confront a problem square in the face. In your organization, I would be a valuable asset.

            <div class="answer">
                My top priority right now is to work for an agency like yours that will allow me to demonstrate my abilities, talent, and expertise.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">4.</span> What are your plans for higher education?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                While I have no intentions to pursue a master’s degree at this time, I am interested in continuing my education, whether it is internal or external. 
                The trends in our industry change so quickly, that I strive to keep up with them through my own personal research. In the past, my employer has also 
                sent me to regular business training to keep my skills up to date.

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question"><span class="qn-num">5.</span> What are your hobbies and interests?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Having one interest is fine, but having two that complement one another and help you develop your skills is always preferable. 
                Nothing else has been able to create in me the highest sense of serenity and self-assurance than my hobbies of practicing Yoga and Meditation. 
                Our work schedules are stressful, and there is no time to relax your muscles. We must be on our toes at all times. 
                <br><br>
                So these have been beneficial, allowing me to disconnect from the outside world and reconnect with my inner self, thus bridging the gap between my mind and spirit. 
                Practicing Yoga and meditation daily also helps me concentrate better at work, and I don’t feel exhausted.
